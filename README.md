This is my FYP Verilog project, titled as "ASIC/FPGA-based Sobel Edge Detection using Stochastic Computing (SC) Design".

This project involves the development of two pipelined designs, namely conventional Binary-Encoded, and non-conventional SC, to be benchmarked in terms of latency, power, area, and max. op. frequency.
